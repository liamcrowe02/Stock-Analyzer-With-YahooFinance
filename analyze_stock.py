Dividends
Dividend Yield: The annual dividend payment divided by the stock price. A higher yield can indicate a good income-generating investment.
Dividend Payout Ratio: The percentage of earnings paid to shareholders in dividends. A lower payout ratio can indicate room for future dividend growth.
Dividend Growth Rate: The annualized percentage rate of growth of a company's dividend payments. Consistent growth is a positive sign.
Dividend History: Stability and consistency in dividend payments over time.
Ex-Dividend Date: The cut-off date to be eligible for the next dividend payment.

Cashflow Statements
Operating Cash Flow (OCF): Cash generated from core business operations. Positive and growing OCF indicates a healthy business.
Free Cash Flow (FCF): OCF minus capital expenditures. Positive FCF indicates the company can fund growth, dividends, or buybacks.
Cash Flow from Investing Activities: Spending on capital expenditures vs. cash received from asset sales. Excessive capital spending can be a red flag.
Cash Flow from Financing Activities: Activities that result in changes in the company's capital structure, like issuing or repurchasing stock, paying dividends, or taking on debt.

Balance Sheets
Current Ratio: Current assets divided by current liabilities. A ratio above 1 indicates good short-term liquidity.
Quick Ratio: (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities. A more stringent test of liquidity than the current ratio.
Debt-to-Equity Ratio: Total debt divided by total shareholders' equity. A lower ratio suggests a company is not heavily reliant on debt.
Return on Equity (ROE): Net income divided by shareholders' equity. Higher ROE indicates efficient use of equity capital.
Total Assets and Liabilities: The overall size and leverage of the company.

Income Statements
Revenue Growth: Increasing revenue over time indicates business growth.
Net Income: Profits after all expenses, taxes, and costs have been deducted from total revenue. Consistent and growing net income is favorable.
Earnings Per Share (EPS): Net income divided by the number of outstanding shares. A higher and growing EPS is positive.
Gross Profit Margin: Gross profit (revenue minus cost of goods sold) divided by revenue. Indicates the efficiency of core operations.
Operating Margin: Operating income divided by revenue. Reflects the efficiency of management and core operations.
Net Profit Margin: Net income divided by revenue. Measures overall profitability.
EBITDA: Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. A measure of operating performance.

Scoring systems so if for example around 21 indicators, if 15 of them are in the green then signal a buy else say sell

Below is another complex example

Example Evaluation:
If we have the following indicators only in the green (positive):

Revenue Growth (Income Statements)
ROE (Balance Sheets)
Total Assets (Balance Sheets)
Operating Cash Flow (Cash Flow Statements)
Dividend Payout Ratio (Dividends)

Let's evaluate these:

Income Statements (1 out of 7): 14.3%
Balance Sheets (2 out of 5): 40%
Cash Flow Statements (1 out of 4): 25%
Dividends (1 out of 4): 25%
In this scenario, none of the sections meet the 70% positive threshold for a buy recommendation, and the percentages indicate more red flags than green lights.

Therefore, with these specific indicators, the stock would likely be considered a sell.

To provide a more concrete example, if 3 out of 4 dividend indicators, 3 out of 4 cash flow indicators, 
4 out of 5 balance sheet indicators, and 5 out of 7 income statement indicators are positive, it would 
strongly suggest a buy. Conversely, significantly fewer positive indicators would suggest a sell.
